Feel free to download the Quantum SoundWave Notebook file and run through or modify it. Please do not copy it for your own Hackathon project (but you can certainly take inspiration).

## Credits:
Thanks to Qiskit, Numpy, and Pyaudio for the respective modules and documentation. Numpy is used for constructing sine functions, Pyaudio is used for converting them into sound waves, and Qiskit is used for simulating quantum circuits and qubits.

Thanks to Liam and ivan_onys from Stack Overflow for help on generating sinusoidal sound waves on Python with Pyaudio.

Thanks to IBM Quantum and the Wisconsin Quantum Computing Club for hosting this event. It has been a fun learning experience working on this project, and I hope to continue exploring this field and expanding on the project.
